## 1 Introduction
Our GroceryListManager app allows user to manage multiple grocery lists for any weekly, monthly or occation grocery shopping. User can seamlessly add or check off items to the list. It is clean, simple and incredibly easy to use.

## 2 Process Description


###1. Inception
	
- This is the first phase in our process. This phase involves elicitation, modeling, analysis and negotiation. In this phase team collects both functional and non functional requirements and also analyzes the main risk.
- Entry criteria: 
	- Initial draft of the requirements from the stakeholders without any technical details.
- Exit criteria: 
	- Project plan documents describing the application and list of phases involved in creating the product along with the team members role.
	- Simplified Use case model 
	- High level architecture of the system.
	- Main risk assessment
	
	It is validated by checking if anything is missing or it has irrelevant requirement. It also involves stake holders going through the use cases to see if all the requirements are covered.

###2. Elaboration

- In this phase, further analysis of the requirements is done by designing high level architecture of the system. Also team address most critical use cases to elimiate highest risk.
- Entry criteria:
	- High level use case model
- Exit criteria:
	- Use case model with all the use cases(around 80%) and actors are identified
	- Supplementary requirement document containg non functional requirements. 
	-  Design document with design consideration and top level components of the system(high level architectural design)
	-  Graphical mockup of the user interface
	-  Test plan without result.
	-  Revised project plan
	
	It can be validated by making sure project plan is sufficently detailed and team has enough information to get started on the system development.


###3. Construction

- This phase involves building the actual product.In this phase team focuses on development activities and building other features of the system. 
- Entry Criteria:
	- Use case model
	- Design document
	- Graphical mockup of the user interface
	- Test plan
- Exit criteria:
	- Revised version of earlier documents
	- All use cases are implemented
	- First code release of the application
	- Test plan with complete results
	- First version of User manual

	It can be validated by making sure product is stable and ready for the deployment. Also running pre designed automated and manual test cases against the developed code along with integration, system and regression test to verify if the code meets all the required requirements.

###4. Transition

- In this phase application is moved from development stage to production, so that it is available for User use. It also involves considering new feature release.
- Entry criteria: All the deliverables from the previous phase
- Exit criteria: 
	- Final version of the app 
	- Product will be in use
	- Retrospective document
	- User training on how to use the application

It can be validated by making sure User is satisfied with the product and it works as expected.
